# C# - Structs, Enumerations
-Structs (structures) are way to group several related variables into one place.
-We can create a struct by using 'struct' key word and declare each of its members inside curly braces.
-A constructor is a special class method called every time an instance of a class is created.
-An enum(enumeration) is a special class that represents a group of constants.
-We can use an enum whenever a procedure accepts a limited set of variables. Enums make more clear and readable code, especially if meaningful names are used.
