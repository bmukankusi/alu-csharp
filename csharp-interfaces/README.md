## C# - Interfaces
What is an Interface? 
An interface in C# is a contract that defines a set of methods, properties, events, or indexers without implementing them. A class or struct that implements the interface must provide an implementation for all its members.
# Key Characteristics of an Interface
- Declares methods but does not provide implementations.
- Used to achieve multiple inheritance since a class can implement multiple interfaces.
- Cannot contain fields, constructors, or destructors.
- All members are public by default.
- Supports polymorphism by allowing different classes to implement the same interface in their own way.
